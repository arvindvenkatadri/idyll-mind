<h1>My First Post</h1>
<p>I finally managed to get <code>RStudio + Github + Academic + Netlify</code> working! And the URL bestowed upon me by Netlify felt good too, <code>https://kind-varahamihira.netlify.app</code> so Iâ€™ve decided to retain it.</p>
<p>Hopefully this first post will mark a beginning wherein I become not just more savvy with tools, but more considerate and nuanced with concepts and explanations. I want to teach myself <code>idyll</code> and use it to create explanations for things that I am reading. That may help me with my own teaching practice and may also provide some food for thought to some kind soul passing by!</p>
