# My First Post

I finally managed to get `RStudio + Github + Academic + Netlify` working! And the URL bestowed upon me by Netlify felt good too, `https://kind-varahamihira.netlify.app` so I've decided to retain it.

Hopefully this first post will mark a beginning wherein I become not just more savvy with tools, but more considerate and nuanced with concepts and explanations. I want to teach myself `idyll` and use it to create explanations for things that I am reading. That may help me with my own teaching practice and may also provide some food for thought to some kind soul passing by!
